# COVID-19 cases and deaths based on WHO data 

## Description
This is a simple Excel dashboard that takes COVID-19 cases and deaths data from World Health Organization (WHO) to show how various countries rank in terms of cases and deaths and show daily trend per country. I created this dashboard to apply what I've learned from the Udemy course ["Visually Effective Dashboard"](https://www.udemy.com/course/excel-dashboards-reports/) but thought I might as well share this work to others who might benefit from it.
