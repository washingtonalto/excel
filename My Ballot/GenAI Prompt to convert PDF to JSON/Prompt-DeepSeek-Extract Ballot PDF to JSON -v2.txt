Objective:
Convert Philippine election ballot PDFs into a standardized JSON format for any legislative district, preserving bilingual instructions (English/Filipino) and candidate data.
Strict Requirements:
1.	Metadata (Required fields):
	o	election_date: "MAY 12, 2025" (exact format)
	o	location: Full district name in ALL CAPS (e.g., "DANIEL FAJARDO, CITY OF LAS PIÑAS, NATIONAL CAPITAL REGION - FOURTH DISTRICT")
	o	clustered_precinct_id: Exact alphanumeric ID (e.g., "76010033")
	o	precincts_in_cluster: Array of precinct codes (e.g., ["0071A", "0072A"])

2.	Position Schema (Repeat for all positions):
=====
{
  "position": "[Exact position name]",
  "vote_for": [Max votes allowed],
  "instructions": {
    "english": "[Exact English instructions]",
    "filipino": "[Exact Filipino translation]"
  },
  "candidates": [
    {
      "number": [Candidate number],
      "name": "[Exact name formatting]",
      "party": "[Party abbreviation or 'IND']"
    }
  ]
}
=====
	o	For PARTY LIST: Omit party field, only include number and name.

3.	Data Rules:
	o	Preserve ALL original capitalization, punctuation, and line breaks in candidate names.
	o	Handle multi-page ballots by combining data for the same position.
	o	Treat "IND" as the party value for independent candidates.
	o	Include ALL candidates, even if the list is long.

4.	Special Cases:
	o	If position names include bilingual text (e.g., "/ Vote for 1"), preserve both versions.
	o	For precinct clusters spanning multiple lines, combine into a single array.
Output Example:
=====
{
  "election_date": "MAY 12, 2025",
  "location": "[FULL DISTRICT NAME FROM PDF]",
  "clustered_precinct_id": "[EXACT ID]",
  "precincts_in_cluster": ["0001A", "0001B"],
  "positions": [
    {
      "position": "SENATOR / Vote for 12",
      "vote_for": 12,
      "instructions": {
        "english": "Mark the inside...",
        "filipino": "Markahan ang loob..."
      },
      "candidates": [
        {"number": 1, "name": "LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME", "party": "PFP"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
=====


Validation Instructions:
1.	Verify all fields against the PDF - no omissions allowed.
2.	Maintain original PDF ordering of candidates.
3.	Flag any inconsistencies in the source PDF for review.


Adaptability Note:
This template works for ALL Philippine legislative districts. The only variables are:
	•	District name in location
	•	Precinct IDs
	•	Candidate lists per position
Language Handling:
	•	Preserve both English and Filipino text where present.
	•	If instructions appear only once, assume they apply to both languages.
Example Meta-Description for JSON Output:
"Structured election ballot data compliant with COMELEC standards, containing complete candidate lists per position with bilingual instructions. Valid for all Philippine legislative districts in the 2025 national elections."
